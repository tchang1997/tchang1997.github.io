Hi, I'm Trenton! I am a final-year EECS PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan AI lab, advised by [Jenna Wiens](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). During Summer 2024, I interned at Microsoft Research Redmond with the [Augmented Reasoning & Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/augmented-learning-and-reasoning/) mentored by Adith Swaminathan and Tobias Schnabel.

I work on **ML alignment with domain-specific values throughout the entire ML lifecycle**, from training to post-deployment. To date, I've worked on:
* Aligning ML models with fairness criteria when learning from biased labels ([MLHC '22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01127), [ICML '24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18865))
* Measuring the steerability of LLMs, with applications to personalization (NeurIPS SafeGenAI '24, [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23816))
* Ensuring ML models are resistant to abuse post-deployment, with applications to health insurance risk adjustment ([NeurIPS '24](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.02000v1))

My work often takes inspiration from healthcare and policy. To that end, I've worked with interdisciplinary teams featuring clinicians, economists, bioethicists, data scientists, and more. Technically, my work has touched areas including ML fairness, strategic classification, causal inference, and LLM evaluation. 

I was previously an CS MS student @ Stanford (2021) and earned a BA in American Studies along the way (2020). Earlier I worked in video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/). I was also a contributor to Google [BIG-bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench).

**Contact.** If you're another researcher in the machine learning, causal inference, or healthcare space--please reach out if you want to chat about research!
