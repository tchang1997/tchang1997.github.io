Hi, I'm Trenton! I am a 4th year EECS PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan AI lab, advised by [Jenna Wiens](https://wiens-group.engin.umich.edu/). During Summer 2024, I was on internship at Microsoft Research Redmond with the [Augmented Reasoning & Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/augmented-learning-and-reasoning/) mentored by Adith Swaminathan and Tobias Schnabel.

I work on **aligning machine learning model behaviors towards high-level principles such as fairness, controllability, and robustness to gaming.** I often take inspiration from health/bioinformatics and policy use cases. My work has intersected with areas including ML fairness, strategic classification, causal inference, and LLM evaluation. 

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford in 2021, and my B.A. in American Studies from Stanford in 2020. I've previously worked on video machine learning robustness with [HazyResearch](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/) and open-domain conversational AI for the Alexa Grand Prize Socialbot Challenge with the [Stanford NLP Group](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/chirpycardinal/). I was also a contributor to the Google [BIG-bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) language model benchmark.

**Contact.** If you're another researcher in the machine learning, causal inference, or healthcare space--please reach out if you want to chat about research! 

**For current Michigan students interested in working with me,** please email me to set up a one-off coffee chat if you'd like to discuss some research ideas.
